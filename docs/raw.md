# Raw Notes

What is its purpose?

The primary purpose of the Project Metrics application is to enable teams to make data-driven decisions and improve their software development processes.

We have found a need to bridge the gap between AzDo and Confluence while reporting and managing projects. Our experience has been that there is a disconnect between the work items and the way we report on projects in Confluence.

By providing a centralized platform for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing project data, the application helps teams identify areas for improvement, track progress towards goals, and make more informed decisions about resource allocation and prioritization.

What problems does it solve?

The Project Metrics application addresses several common challenges faced by software development teams, including:

Difficulty in tracking project progress and identifying bottlenecks or areas for improvement.
Inability to easily visualize and analyze project data, making it difficult to identify trends and patterns.
Limited integration with existing project management tools, such as Azure DevOps, resulting in manual and time-consuming data collection and analysis processes.
Lack of a centralized platform for managing project data and insights, leading to fragmented and inconsistent information across the team.

What benefits does it provide?
Improved project visibility: By integrating with Azure DevOps and providing a centralized platform for managing project data, the application enables teams to easily track progress and identify areas for improvement.
Data-driven decision-making: The application's powerful analytics and visualization capabilities help teams make more informed decisions about resource allocation, prioritization, and process improvements.
Increased efficiency: By automating data collection and analysis processes, the application saves time and reduces manual effort, allowing teams to focus on more strategic tasks.
Enhanced collaboration: The application's centralized platform and intuitive user interface make it easy for team members to share insights, collaborate on analysis, and work together to improve project outcomes.

Overview

Effective team behaviors are crucial for the success of any software development project. The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) encompasses various stages, from planning and design to implementation and maintenance. Each stage requires coordinated efforts, clear communication, and disciplined practices. However, teams often fall into negative behavioral patterns that can jeopardize project outcomes. This section outlines the importance of behavioral change in the SDLC and sets the foundation for understanding how the Project Metrics application can help steer teams towards better practices.


 Common Negative Behaviors
Poor Time Management: Missed deadlines, inefficient meetings, and lack of prioritization can derail project timelines.
Inadequate Work Item Tracking: Unclear task assignments, lack of updates, and poor tracking of progress can lead to confusion and delays.
Unrealistic Estimates: Over-optimistic or vague estimates can result in scope creep, budget overruns, and missed deadlines.
Weak Project Governance: Lack of accountability, unclear roles, and insufficient oversight can lead to project mismanagement and failure.


Behavioral Change Strategies
Awareness: Recognizing the negative behaviors and understanding their impact on the project.
Commitment: Gaining buy-in from all team members to adopt new, positive behaviors.
Tools and Processes: Implementing tools and processes that support and reinforce the desired behaviors.
Continuous Improvement: Regularly reviewing and adjusting practices to ensure ongoing improvement.

 Benefits
Improved Efficiency: Streamlined workflows and better time management can significantly reduce project timelines.
Higher Quality: Attention to detail and adherence to best practices can improve the quality of the final product.
Enhanced Collaboration: Clear communication and well-defined roles can foster a more collaborative and productive team environment.
Greater Accountability: Strong governance and accountability mechanisms ensure that everyone is responsible for their tasks and deliverables.

How does Project Metrics facilitate behavioral change?
Manage Time Effectively: Tools for tracking time, setting deadlines, and prioritizing tasks help teams stay on schedule.
Visualization: Metrics are visualized, giving a deeper level of understanding of the health of a project.
Track Work Items Efficiently: Integration with Azure DevOps ensures clear task assignments, real-time updates, and progress tracking.
Set Realistic Estimates: Historical data analysis and estimation tools help teams set achievable goals and avoid scope creep.
Strengthen Governance: Role-based access, audit trails, and comprehensive reporting ensure strong project governance and accountability.

Behavioral change is essential for the success of software development projects. By understanding the importance of effective behaviors and recognizing common pitfalls, teams can take proactive steps to improve their practices. The application serves as a valuable tool in this journey, providing the support and features needed to drive positive change and achieve project success.

This expanded section provides a comprehensive introduction to the importance of behavioral change in the SDLC, setting the stage for the rest of the page. It highlights the challenges, the need for change, and how the application can help teams improve their behaviors.

Core concepts

Queries

Queries are used to extract data from structured data sources, such as databases or APIs. These queries can be customized to suit the specific needs of the project and can be run against multiple data sources. The results of these queries are then used to generate insights.

Commands

Commands are used to process and structure the data extracted by queries. They can perform various operations, such as filtering, sorting, aggregating, or transforming the data. Commands can also be used to calculate metrics or derive new insights from the data.

Data Visualization

The Project Metrics application provides data visualization tools that help teams better understand their project data. These tools include charts, graphs, tables, and other visual representations that make it easier to identify trends, patterns, and relationships in the data.
